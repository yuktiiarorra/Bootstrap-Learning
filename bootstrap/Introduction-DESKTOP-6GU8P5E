it helps us create nice looking, responsive, modern websites.
it provides us the framework or starting point for all sorts of diff. websites.
consists of two main things ->
1. collection of pre-built COMPONENTS that we can incorporate into our own webistes.
2. GRID SYSTEM which helps us construct our own custom, responsive layouts.
Bootstrap comes with some javascript too but the core / most imp. piece is a single stylesheet.
How to include bootstrap :-
a. download everything and link it.
b. use CDN(Content Delivery Network) - hosted verson of a stylesheet that we can access remotely. copy CDN and paste it in head before 
your custom style sheet. This way I can write my own css and it has a better chance of not being overwritten by bootstrap.
Certain components require js so it's necessary to include the js links.
For grid system we need to work in a container.
WE then need to create rows using class="rows"
All theses Aria prefixed labels have to do with accessibility and screen readers.
A row is generally a div but can be section or something else. It doesn't really represent anything itself. It's just there to help spread out or structure the content or lay it out.
Responsive Bootstrap Grids are used to create responsive layout and shift content around based upon the screen size. It hinges upon the built-in break points in bootstrap.
Bootstrap is built on top of flexbox and thus, uses similar/same terminology.
When we use class = "row" it automatically sets display as flex.
In a form changing border, size, color etc of a checkbox is difficult compared to a regular input like text, password. So, we use the browser's checkbox along with the class="form-check". It sets the spacing slight differently OR we use the bootstrap checkbox. 
Similarly, we can get customizations for radio buttons, switches(built on top of a checkbox), selects, multi-selects, range input etc.
Collapse plugin is a part of bootstrap we can use to collapse things and show, hide them like creating an accordion, show or hide content to collapse the navbar / drawer.
It's necessary to have boostrap js while using collapsible navbar.
In navbars I can create custom color schemes, set background color on navbar, place them differently.
We can add a container inside our navbar and our data inside container will be constrained.
Bootstrap icons are free to use. Headovder to the website and copy the link to use them. The link has an HTML element SVG(Scale Vector Graphics) which are used to build modern, artistic, cool-looking websites, animations, games etc. 
HOW SVG's WORK ? the information(link) describes the actual path that we see in form of visual. The info describes the shape(paths at play here). They are scalable, change color similar to a letter / font. 
There are other icon libraries like FontAwesome.
Other bootstrap utilities contains ways of applying some CSS styles like turning a border ON or OFF, adding a border radius or changing the display property, adding margin. The utilities allow us to do them with a single class.
Border utility to add border all four sides. We cannot control the width through bootstrap. We have to set a width to a default thickness. We can use an additive or subtractive(so we could turn the border off) version. We can change border colors, radius, larger or smaller rounding of border-radius.
Shadow utility is used to quickly add a show. We don't have a lot of control over it. Some options are shadow-none, shadow-sm, shadow, shadow-lg.
Classes Margin and padding properties have a lot of letters. 
format => {property}{sides}-{size} for xs, {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, xl. 
m => margin, p => padding, t => top, b => bottom, l => left, r => right, x => both *-left and *-right, y => both *-top and *-bottom, blank => all 4 sides.
size => 0, 1 => ($spacer * .25), 2 =>($spacer * .5) and so on but 5 => ($spacer * 3), auto =>  margin where spacer is a predetermined size.
Other available utilities are display, flex, size of elements.
        OTHER BOOTSTRAP STUFF
card => generic content container where we can mix and match content. Often used in grid system. We can have a grid of cards, we have options like add titles, subtitles, images on top, list group, specail header and footer. They are very flexible and are basically a box with border with some optinal special pieces inside like header, footer. We can create nice grids and display our content nicely using cards.
carousel => to make an image gallery / slider. There are a lot of parameters. We can have controls or indicators at bottom, automatic sliders where everything's hidden and the user doesn't do anything. We can have a  faded versus slide effect. It involves a lot of JS. We have to connect the controls.
dropdown menus => they can be of diff. sizes, attached to button, pop up versus pop down, pop left or pop right. We can have diff. stuff in menu, diff. alignments.
spinner => different options like spinner-grow or spinner-border(rotating round border) etc. are available.
progress => displays a progress bar.
modals => pop up dialogues. We have to figure out / specify where we should launch it, what should close it, if there's a close button etc. We can make a scrollable one where we scroll the container or scroll the enitire page. We can center them vertically or use the grid system inside them etc. It requires a lot of JS.
